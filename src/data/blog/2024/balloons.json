Memories of being fourteen years old, tinkering with <em>RPG Maker 2003</em>, and of being wide-eyed and dreaming big with the release of <em>RPG Maker XP</em>. I remembered making ugly sprites in a program called <em>GraphicsGale</em>, and falling in love with <em>Suikoden II</em>’s spritesheets way before playing the game itself."
