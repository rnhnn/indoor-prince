One of the coolest parts was seeing <a href=\"https://valstuff.com\" target=\"_blank\">Val</a> participate in a localization jam for the first time ever. She worked on a game called <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/locjam-6/rate/2643122\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Not Enough Time</em></a>—a title that fit perfectly with how we rushed in the final minutes before the jam’s deadline, frantically debugging syntax problems to make the game load. A classic dev story, surely."
