Nancy Maple rules from the start, and the ending I got left me feeling very inspired, with ideas on how to approach the development of a narrative game—but also with a desire to go back and finally play through those Laura Bow adventures I missed as a kid. Especially <em>The Colonel’s Bequest</em>, which I also remember finding a bit scary... but surely it’s going to be fine now!"
